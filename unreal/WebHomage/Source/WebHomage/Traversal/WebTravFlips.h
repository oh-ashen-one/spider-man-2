// Homage fan game. Not an official Marvel, Sony or Insomniac game; no affiliation.
// Piece P3 round 11 (owner brief FLIPS_BRIEF.md, spec docs/night1/traversal/FLIPS_SPEC.md): gymnast flip programs.
// A flip program is a timeline of held gymnastic SHAPES (tuck, pike, layout, swan, pencil, straddle, throne, twist, reach,
// keyed in Blender on the hero rig: /Game/Traversal/HeroDev/flip<Shape>). The body rotation is not keyed: it follows one
// angular momentum through the whole program, rate = L * env(t) / I(shape(t)), so the flip spins fast through a tuck and
// slows almost to a hold in an open shape (pencil / swan / throne) -- the ease comes from the shapes, as in real tumbling.
// L is solved so the program ends exactly at its total angle (upright). Twists (corkscrews) turn about the body's long axis
// inside their own segments. Limbs overlap: the upper body samples the timeline FlipLead s ahead, the legs FlipLag s behind.
// Pure functions: the traversal (durations, telemetry), the character (root rotation) and the anim instance (shapes) all
// sample the same program at the same time.
