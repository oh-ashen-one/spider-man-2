// Homage fan game. Not an official Marvel, Sony or Insomniac game; no affiliation.
// Piece P3: UWebTraversalComponent — C++ port of the browser's Insomniac-style traversal state machine
// (src/player/traversal/traversal.js). It runs its own 120 Hz substep and owns the body while it is active
// (CharacterMovement is switched off); collision uses Unreal traces / capsule penetration (FWebTravWorld).
//
//   modes: ground | air | swing | zip | perch | wall   (+ anim mode 'land' while a landing recovery plays)
//   kin moves: vault | cornerWrap | wallHop (scripted curves that take over the step)
//
// Owner feel notes from the browser are kept next to the code they shaped (user r4..r13, feedback #3..#19).
// Not ported yet (browser features): web slingshot (Ctrl), web tightrope (T), water plunge / yank, bridge halfway
// bounce, car-roof riding (C3 dynamics), tree-canopy anchors, Shift-walk (disabled in the browser too: user r-nowalk).
//
// Simulation units are METRES (browser constants unchanged), UE axes (Z up). Yaw angles: atan2(Y, X).
