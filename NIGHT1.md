# Opus 5.5 Loop — Night 1 (ownership contract)

> Homage fan game. Not an official Marvel, Sony or Insomniac game; no affiliation, nothing here is meant to infringe. See `DISCLAIMER.md`.

Integration branch: **`Opus-5.5-Loop-Night-1`** (worktree `~/spider-man-2-astra6`, owned by the orchestrator session).
Target: Marvel's Spider-Man 2 quality — traversal, Manhattan streets, characters, animation, combat, cohesion.
Hardware: Mac Studio M3 Ultra (80-core GPU, 256 GB). Output target **3840×2160 @ 60 fps**, internal resolution always disclosed, perf measured during real gameplay.

## Pieces and owners

Each piece has its own branch, worktree, Unreal content folder, MCP port and Blender instance. **Only the owner edits its folders.** Shared files (`main.js`, `.uproject`, `Config/Default*.ini`, `Source/WebHomage/WebHomage.Build.cs`) change only through the integrator.

| F 4K/60 perf (wave 2) | `night1/perf` | `~/sm2-n1/perf` | `tools/perf_ue/` successors, `docs/night1/perf/` | 8778 | — |

Evidence goes to `docs/night1/<piece>/round-NN/` (captures, clips, perf CSV, critic verdicts). Large videos are committed as mp4 ≤ 15 MB each.

## Loop per piece

1. Builder builds → runs the real game → captures matching views / movement sequences listed in `docs/night1/<piece>/SHOTLIST.md`.
2. A **fresh critic** (new agent, no builder summary) gets only the rendered captures/clips + the matching Spider-Man 2 references, anonymised A/B where practical, and returns: scores per axis, the **single biggest gap**, and a verdict (`FAILS TARGET` / `APPROACHES TARGET` / `MEETS TARGET`) with evidence.
3. Builder fixes that one gap. Repeat. No fixed round count; a piece closes only on a critic `MEETS TARGET` backed by evidence.
4. Between waves, a fresh integration agent plays the merged game (browser + UE), logs regressions, fixes coherence.

## Protected (never touch)

`~/spider-man-2` (flight-dynamics session), `~/spider-man-2-claude` (3d-animations-astra), `~/spider-man-2-water-effects`, dev ports 5173/5191, Blender MCP port 19891 and any Blender/Unreal instance this loop did not start, branch `main`.

## Model assignment (owner, 2026-09-29 — applies to every spawn after 14:20; running work finishes as is)

| Role | Model / effort |
|---|---|
| Builders — hard/central engineering: P3 traversal, C Manhattan integration, P5 combat, F perf | **Opus 5.5, high** (`opus-critic` type or Workflow `{model:'opus', effort:'high'}`) |
| Builders — pipelines/assets/tooling: P1 city, P2 characters, P4 look, P6 city life, A GPU lock | **Sonnet 5.5, extra-high** (`sm2-sonnet-builder`, or Workflow `{model:'sonnet', effort:'xhigh'}`) |
| Critics every round; integration playtester between waves; any super-important engineering by judgment | **Opus 5.5, high** (`opus-critic`, or Workflow `{model:'opus', effort:'high'}`) |
| Direction: wave planning, reconciling contradictory critic demands, deciding what runs next and whether a piece is done | **Fable 5.1, high** (`fable-director`, or Workflow `{model:'fable', effort:'high'}`) — sparingly (own weekly limit): one pass per wave, stall/oscillation diagnosis, final acceptance |

Continuity between fresh builders comes from `docs/night1/<piece>/HANDOFF.md`, rewritten at the end of every round.
