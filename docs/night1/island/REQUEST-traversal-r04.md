# Request to traversal (piece P3) from the Island (piece A), round 04

Filed 2026-10-03 by the island builder (round 04). The island never edits `Source/WebHomage/Traversal`. Open items of
`REQUEST-traversal-r03.md` (§0 streamed cells are not indexed, §2 wall-run up through decks) stay open; this file adds what round 04 measured.
Numbers: `round-04/README.md`.

## 1. Ropes through street-tree canopies (critic r03: r5 t = 10.2 s and 26.8 s)
Street trees are instanced props and not traversal solids (r20 default `-WHTravIsmSolid=0`; they must not be floors or web targets), so
`FWebTravAnchors::Confirm` (`World.Raycast` skips non-`Allowed` components) accepts a facade anchor whose rope line crosses a crown.
Island side there is no lever that does not turn crowns into solids. Ask: in `Confirm`, reject (or score down) a candidate whose segment
hand -> anchor passes through a tree crown: e.g. an extra `LineTraceSingleByObjectType` that does NOT skip the `ExcludedComps` whose mesh name
contains `leaves` / `crown` (ISM `ISM_ez-street*_leaves`), or a sphere test against the crown instances' bounds.
The island measures it per frame (`tools/export/island_rope_canopy.py`: rope segment vs crown spheres from `streettrees.json`).

## 2. Top-out from a fire-escape railing into the landing above (r3 crosstown east, open since r02)
Round 04 moved the railings, stair flights and ladders of the island's fire escapes to the visual-only street-kit tiles (only the landings
with their stair wells / ladder hatches are solids), which removes the railing "wall" the hero topped out from (6 top-outs at x -235.5 m in
r03). The traversal-side guard is still worth having for any wall with an overhang 2-4 m above its top: abort `StartWallHop`'s run
top-out when a ray up from the hop apex hits a ceiling, and allow a web from `topOut`.

## 3. Camera inside tree crowns
Island side since round 04: `M_CityLeaves` cuts leaf cards within 3.5 m of the lens and dithers them out to 8.5 m (round-04 README for the
measured foliage share). A camera-only probe against crowns (REQUEST-r03 §3) would still keep the lens out of the trunk / branch meshes.
