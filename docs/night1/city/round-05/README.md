> Homage fan game. Not an official Marvel, Sony or Insomniac game; no affiliation.

Running game: `Scripts/run_game.sh` (`-game`, offscreen, map `/Game/Tests/City/City_View_<id>`, auto-activated CameraActor), screenshot at t = 28 s.
Frame times: game seconds 18-28, `t.MaxFPS 0`, no VSync, TSR with automatic screen percentage. GPU utilization read with ioreg before each run
(GPU shared with other sessions; the P1 editor was closed during the runs). Positions in browser metres (x east, y up, z south); UE = (100x, 100z, 100y) cm.

## Changes since round 04 (facts only)
- Street level (ground to the second-floor cornice), both sides of every avenue face in the detailed block: 578 faces / 2225 storefront bays built as
  geometry (`tools/export/street_kit.py`): piers, stepped cornice, 3D storefront frames with mullions and doors, fascia boards with original generic shop names,
  fabric awnings with lettered valances or metal marquees, fire escapes (616 built on pre-war, side and deco faces, see
  streetkit.json), about 580 k triangles, Nanite, material `M_CityKit`.
- Shop interiors drawn analytically (four shop types, customers, floors, side walls) instead of the blurred atlas photos.
- Sidewalks: 1.5 m slab joints, per-slab tone, hairline cracks (visible in sunlit areas; the S1 avenue sidewalks are in canyon shade).
- Street furniture: hydrant / trash can / newspaper box / tree pit about every 20 m of avenue frontage (149 / 151 / 143 / 127 supplemental instances).
- S1 corridor: ~45 % of the street trees left out (100 % in front of the west deco podium, z 40-152); SkyLight intensity 1.0 -> 1.7 in every view map.
- IP: ad cells L27, P27, P38 and L35 (COLTEX / COLEXCO) replaced in the Unreal copy; see docs/night1/city/IP_EXCLUSIONS.md. OCR of the eight 4K frames finds
  none of the excluded names.
- S1 test crop (4K, x 0-1600, y 800-1700): `S1_crop_x0-1600_y800-1700.jpg`; the fire escapes of the far west tower: `S1_crop_fire_escapes_x1100-1900_y450-1000.jpg`.
  Projection census of kit elements into that crop (not depth-tested, trees and buildings ignored): 556 fascia boards, 198 awnings, 101 marquees, 142 fire escapes.
- Not re-measured this round: the window-glass brightness numbers of round 04.
