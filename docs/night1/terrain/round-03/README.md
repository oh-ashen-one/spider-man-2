# Terrain round 03 — canopy reads as leaves at every distance: captures and measurements

> Homage fan game. Not an official Marvel, Sony or Insomniac game; no affiliation. See `DISCLAIMER.md`.

Target (round-02 critic's biggest gap, Fable round target): the 165-520 m band becomes clustered leaf-card canopies, the canopy is lit by the engine instead of a constant emissive,
plus a silhouette test, and shore stills with the merged water. PASS needs: all 24 `p1_south` crown crops (round-02 boxes, `crops.json` copied unchanged) sigma-3 SD >= 9;
no foliage patch > 40 px with local luma SD <= 1.4 in `p1_south` (dark pockets included); no straight crown-silhouette edge > 40 px in `p10_lawn_eye`; capture GPU ms vs r2 disclosed.

**Status: PASS 1 captured and measured (this file); pass 2 queued (see "Pass 2" below).**

## Build (all in committed scripts; Content is generated, never committed)
1. `tools/export/collect_terrain.js`: exports `trees-{park,elm,conifer}-lod1` — the browser's own LOD1 generator (trees.js `canopyGeometry`, evaluated from the served trees.js source
   against the app's three.js and layout.js `mulberry32`, lobes from eztrees.js `buildEzArchetypes().lobes`) with `CARDS[kind][2..3]` = 22 x 2.8 m / 24 x 3.0 m / 18 x 2.0 m cards + solid
   core 0.85 (4 lobes, detail 0), instances = the near pool's, band 165-520 m. Self-check: the same code with the LOD0 recipe reproduces the exported `trees-*-near` geometry (all three kinds: true).
2. `build_terrain.py`: LOD1 pools on `M_TerrainCards`, no shadows; the clump hull (`trees-*-crown`, `M_TerrainClump`) only >= 520 m (band 520-3200), `trees-*-crownfar` no longer built;
   `Foliage.ush` bump back at the browser's 3.0 / 0.5.
3. **Why the r02 cards crushed to black** (found in the UE 5.8 source): Lumen runs with hardware ray tracing here; `RayTracingInstanceMask.cpp` makes every drawn primitive visible to indirect rays
   whatever `affect_dynamic_indirect_lighting` says ("only path tracing obeys the AffectsDynamicIndirectLighting flag"), and Lumen's minimal any-hit shader (`LumenHardwareRayTracingCommon.ush`
   `LumenMinimalRayAnyHitShader`) never evaluates an opacity mask. Every masked leaf pool was an opaque shell to Lumen, and the crown hull (no band clip outside raster) closed a solid ball
   around every card canopy at every distance: sky rays from a leaf hit it at once. Fix: foliage pools `visible_in_ray_tracing = False` (bark / trunks stay in).
4. `terrain_materials.py`: the constant `Emis = c * 1800 * (0.4 + 0.6 expo)` is gone from `M_TerrainLeaves` / `M_TerrainCards`; exposure drives material AO (`lerp(0.7, 1, expo)`, sky / indirect only)
   and a residual fill `c * FILL * tfFillW(...)` that is 0 on sun-facing outer leaves (SkyAtmosphere light direction), 0 within 10 m, ramps in to 30 m (`Foliage.ush tfFillW`). Two-sided foliage + subsurface unchanged.
5. Water: `build_water.py` run in this worktree (scratch `_scratch/terrain/water`); `Water_River` is a sublevel of every `V_*` / `VB_*` still map and `Manhattan_Terrain`; the city's flat WaterPlane is hidden in the private `City_Geo_T` copy too.
6. `crown_stats.py`: flat test counts dark pockets (luma < 40 near foliage); new silhouette test (foliage / sky boundary, Douglas-Peucker 1.5 px; axis-aligned, dark, thin or brick-hued segments listed apart with the reason).

Offline checks: `check_hlsl.py` 12 / 12, `scw_check.py` 27 / 27 permutations (UE ShaderCompileWorker, now also with new input pins). Warm-up shader check clean.

## Measured (pass 1)
| test | target | round 03 pass 1 | round 02 |
|---|---|---|---|
| E9a crown crops sigma-3 SD (24 boxes) | all >= 9 | **FAIL**: min 4.28, median 7.74, max 12.09, 5 / 24 >= 9 (far 11.0-12.1; mid 6.7-9.8; near-right 6.3-7.8; foreground 4.3-7.8) | min 5.41, median 8.34, 10 / 24 |
| E9b flat foliage patch > 40 px (dark pockets incl.) | none in p1 | **PASS**: p1 max 24.7 px, dark pockets 0.06 % of the frame; p10 16.0 px | p1 126.8 px (6 patches, black pockets), same checker |
| E9c straight crown silhouette in p10 | <= 40 px | **FAIL (47.2 px, 1 segment > 40)**: the left edge of a near leaf spray (quad border); set aside: building edges, a bare limb, the lamp head | 75.6 px (8 segments > 40, clump-hull facets), same checker |
| E9d capture GPU ms (same hold, r02 scripts built side by side into `/Game/TerrainR2`) | disclosed | p1 **156.2-160.6 ms** vs r02 **163.8 ms**; p10 **90.3-91.8 ms** vs r02 **89.1 ms** (4K output, 1080p internal, frame-capped, not an exclusive perf lock: contaminated) | |
| E1 lawn crops (sigma 6, 512 px) | guard | p10 7.43 / 6.34 (r02 6.10 / 5.32), p9 2.63 (2.33), p4 1.41 (1.33) | |
| E2 / E3 | | 89.9 % / 0 gaps (unchanged) | |

Reading: the 165-520 m band is now leaf cards (no boulders; p1 / p10 / p9 look leafy at every distance) and the black pockets are gone, but the leaf-scale contrast fell:
the LOD1 core spheres read as smooth round puffs, and with every leaf pool out of ray tracing nothing occludes the sky under the canopy, so the foreground boxes that held black pockets in r02
now hold smooth sky-lit lawn (boxes [2250,1800], [1500,1950], [2100,1950] = 4.3-5.9).

## Pass 2 (queued, scripts committed)
Lumen-only shade proxy (each crown hull at 0.6 scale about its centre, hidden in game, visible to ray tracing + `affect_indirect_lighting_while_hidden`: occludes sky under / inside the crown,
not the cards' outward rays); LOD1 core broken up by world-space clump noise + holes; deeper spray-interior occlusion and wider per-leaf value spread on the cards; ragged card / leaf quad borders;
fill 700 -> 450.

## Known defects
p6 shows a lighter rectangular seam on the water near the seawall (not yet traced); far crowns >= 520 m are the clump hull (bump 3.0 / 0.5); the lawn tufts are still star sprites (r4, Sonnet);
pond-bank rocks, esplanade dressing deferred to r4.
