# Homage fan game. Not an official Marvel, Sony or Insomniac game; no affiliation.
# P3 round 25 critic pack (like with like). Round target = the web line readable on every web frame of the swing chain (2-4 px at 1080p),
# so the swing / perch / run pairs are cut at FULL 1920x1080 on both sides (ours and the 1080p reference clip; abpack.py centre-crops 84 %
# and keeps the pixel scale) -- r22-r24 packs were 610x556 crops scaled to 512x466 (a 3 px line became ~1.3 px). Multi-flip and the two
# wall-run pairs keep the r24 610x556 refcuts (unchanged axes). Plus r24 vs r25 on the swing chain and the c perch.
# Refcuts are scratch-only copies (from the private refs), never committed.
