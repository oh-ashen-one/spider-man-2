# Homage fan game. Not an official Marvel, Sony or Insomniac game; no affiliation.
# P3 round 26 critic pack (like with like). Round target: the w1 vertical wall run as a sprint (knees, arms, a new pose every 0.3 s) at a
# 4-7 m camera, the original suit in every clip, no regression on rope / perch / pawn run / flips. Every clip pair keeps the FULL 1080p pixel
# scale (centre 1440x1080 of ours and of the 1080p reference clip; abpack.py centre-crops 84 %). Every pair also gets an image pair: a
# <= 2048 px wide contact sheet of each side at the same sample times (the r25 critic could only open contact sheets).
# Progress pairs r25 vs r26: w1, c, a, f4 (the r25 f4 file is round-24's, not re-captured in r25).
# Refcuts are scratch-only copies (from the private refs), never committed.
