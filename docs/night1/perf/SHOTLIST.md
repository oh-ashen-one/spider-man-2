# F perf: shot list (Night 1)

> Homage fan game. Not an official Marvel, Sony or Insomniac game; no affiliation. Reference stills live in the private repo

Every capture is the RUNNING game (`Scripts/run_game.sh`, offscreen `-game`, true 3840x2160 back buffer) on the integrated Manhattan map (piece C's
`/Game/Maps/Manhattan`, golden rig), inside `gpu_slot.sh capture` (stills / clips) or `gpu_slot.sh perf` (frame times). "Before" = the build as
found (all Epic-tier defaults, HWRT Lumen, `r.Nanite.MaxPixelsPerEdge 1`), "after" = `overrides/perf60.cvars` + the content transformations kept in the round.
Internal resolution is `r.ScreenPercentage 50` = 1920x1080 unless a row says otherwise; TSR upscales to the output.

**Round 02 update:** "after" = `overrides/perf60_hwrefl.cvars` (hardware-RT reflections, software GI, Nanite error 6) on the RT-lite map copy with the 4 km cloud (`/Game/PerfF/Cl4RT/`) at `r.ScreenPercentage 46` = 1766x994 internal (`stills/after_settings.json`);
"before" = as found (TSR 50 % = 1920x1080 internal). Extra route stills at game t = 38 / 42 s (late route, horizon). The R2 clip is a 1080p60 fixed-step movie at native 1080p internal with the Nanite error halved (footage only).
P-R = route frame times at TSR 44 / 46 / 50 (hardware-RT) and 50 / 58 (software), `round-02/perf/s4_official`; P-S2 = static S2 at TSR 46.

| id | view / movement | camera | before / after | reference (private) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | avenue canyon at street level, looking north (`/Game/Maps/Manhattan_View_S1`) | P1 shot S1_avenue_street | 4K still x2 | `streets/street-avenue-hero-taxis__og_0000` |
| S2 | 42 m over the avenue, mid-swing height (`Manhattan_View_S2`); also the heavy-view perf line P3 | P1 shot S2_avenue_swing | 4K still x2 + static-view perf | `streets/street-midtown-high__og_0410` |
| S7 | sunset cross street, 30 m up, looking west into the sun (F's local `/Game/PerfF/View_S7`, `tools/perf_ue2/make_views.py`) | P1 shot S7_sunset_crosstown | 4K still x2 | `streets/sunset-swing-trailer__eny_0142` |
| R1 | 30 s scripted swing route (C `route_30s_warmup15.json`), stills at route t = 5 s and 13 s (game 20 s / 28 s) | P3 chase camera | 4K still x2 | `traversal/swing-avenue-canyon-above__nm_0557` |
| R2 | the same route as a clip: 1920x1080 output at native internal resolution, `r.Nanite.MaxPixelsPerEdge 2` (= the 4 px of the 4K run), fixed 1/60 s step. Footage only: it says nothing about real-time speed | P3 chase camera | mp4 (after) | - |
| P-R | frame times of R1 for 30 s, 3840x2160 output at TSR 50 / 58 / 67 % | - | perf tables | - |
| P-S2 | frame times of S2 (static camera, 30 s) at TSR 50 % | - | perf table | - |

**Round 03 update:** everything is on the REBUILT integrated map (`tools/perf_ue2/build_map.py`, see `round-03/NOTES.md`). "After" = the shipped path: preset `overrides/perf60_hwl.cvars` (full hardware-RT Lumen, Nanite error 8, skeletal meshes out of the ray-tracing scene) +
`r.ScreenPercentage 50` (1920x1080 internal at 3840x2160 output) read from `Config/Mac/MacEngine.ini`, content = rebuilt + `perf_apply rt_lite,cloud` (spec `name@ini`, no per-run cvars). "Before" = the same rebuilt map as found (no preset, content untouched, TSR 50, Nanite error 1, hardware GI + reflections).
Stills: S1, S2, S7 and route t = 20 / 28 / 38 / 42 s at 3840x2160 (committed as 1920x1080 JPEG in `round-03/stills/`); R2 clip `round-03/route_30s.mp4` = 1920x1080 output at native 1080p internal (`r.ScreenPercentage 100`, Nanite error 4 = the 8 px of the 4K run halved), fixed step, footage only;
P-R = `round-03/perf/f1` (`hwl_a`, `hwl_b`), P-S2 = `f1/hwl_s2`. Crops for P7: `tools/perf_ue2/crop_ssim.py --set r03`.

**Round 04 update:** same views and route on the same rebuilt map (no new merge). "After" = the shipped path with preset `overrides/perf60_hwl2.cvars` (round-03 `perf60_hwl` + `r.Shadow.Virtual.UseFarShadowCulling 0`, `r.Shadow.Virtual.Clipmap.UseConservativeCulling 1`,
`r.VolumetricCloud.DistanceToSampleMaxCount 50`, `r.RayTracing.Culling.Angle 3`) + `r.ScreenPercentage 50` from `Config/Mac/MacEngine.ini` (1920x1080 internal at 3840x2160 output), content = rebuilt + `perf_apply rt_lite_trees,tree_rt_opaque,cloud` (cloud 20 km).
"Before" = the round-03 as-found stills of the same build (`_scratch/perf/r03/before`). Stills S1 / S2 / S7 / route t20 / t28 / t38 / t42 in `round-04/stills/` (JPEG of the 4K PNGs), three-way comparisons (as found | round 03 | round 04) in `round-04/cmp/`,
R2 clip `round-04/route_30s.mp4` (1080p output = internal, Nanite error 4, fixed step, footage only), P-R = `round-04/perf/f1` (`ship_a/b/c`), P-S2 = `f1/ship_s2`, look gate `round-04/LOOK_GATE.md` (round-02 crops, not moved).

**Round 05 update:** merged integration 3aa92ba (traversal r14 camera, characters r6; P2 inputs staged from P2's head 8ab861a), rebuilt (`build_map.py --steps cpp,characters,map`, then `tree_proxy,perf_apply,perf_preset,perf_audit`). "After" = the round-04 preset `perf60_hwl2` + `r.ScreenPercentage 50` (1920x1080 internal at 3840x2160 output) and content = rebuilt + `perf_apply rt_lite_trees,rt_proxy_trees,cloud`: the tree leaves / crowns / bark leave the ray-tracing scene and 402 merged per-tile ray-tracing proxies (`/Game/PerfF/RTProxy`, hidden in game, affect indirect lighting while hidden) replace them.
Same views S1 / S2 / S7 and route t20 / t28 / t38 / t42 (`round-05/stills/`, JPEG of the 4K PNGs); the route camera is P3's r14 camera now, so route frames are NOT the round-03 / round-04 frames (framing changed; the as-found route stills of `_scratch/perf/r03/before` are no longer a like-for-like reference). R2 clip `round-05/route_30s.mp4` (1080p output = internal, footage only).
New perf rows: P-R control `r4_*` = the round-04 content on today's build (`/Game/PerfF/RTvRk20`, leaves as 42 k HISM instances in the ray-tracing scene, proxies out), `notree` (`RTvNk20`, no tree geometry in ray tracing), and P-L = the same route WITH P6's traffic + crowd (`/Game/PerfF/Life/Manhattan`, `tools/perf_ue2/build_life_variant.sh`).

**Round 06 update:** same build as round 05 (no merge), same views and route. "After" = preset `perf60_hwl3` (= `perf60_hwl2` + GPU skin cache off) + `r.ScreenPercentage 50` from `Config/Mac/MacEngine.ini` (1920x1080 internal at 3840x2160 output), content = rebuilt + `perf_apply rt_lite_trees,rt_proxy_trees,rt_occluders,cloud` (new: sidewalk sheds / shelters / kiosks back in ray tracing).
Stills S1 / S2 / S7 / route t20 / t28 / t38 / t42 in `round-06/stills/final_*.jpg` (JPEG of the 4K PNGs). **New rows with P6's traffic + crowd ON** (`/Game/PerfF/Life/Manhattan`): route stills t20 / t28 `round-06/stills/life_route_*.jpg`, and clip R2-L `round-06/route_life_30s.mp4` (same settings as R2). R2 clip `round-06/route_30s.mp4` (1920x1080 output = internal, Nanite error 4, fixed step, footage only).
P-R = `round-06/perf/f1` (`ship_a/b/c`), P-L = `f1/life_a/b/c`, P-S2 = `f1/s2`. Look comparisons `round-06/cmp/` (S1 recess and round-02 crop: as found | round 05 | round 06; rejected cuts).
