# P2 Characters, round 06: blind critic (Opus 5.5)

Homage fan game, not affiliated with Marvel, Sony or Insomniac. Captures are on the flat test stage, so lighting is not judged. Pixel coordinates are native 4K unless noted.

## Scores
| Axis | Score | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Hero model & suit (CH1/3/4/5) | **4** | `hero_face_lens_4k`, right lens (x≈3140–3240, y≈700–1500): the rim is still doubled, and background shows between the rim and a floating lens sheet. Left lens: the rim splits at the top corner (x≈1650–1700, y≈760–800) and a white lens sliver pokes through. Mask web lines stair-step at 4K. The weave is fine. **IP:** the Advanced-Suit layout is unchanged (SPEC header). Compared with miles-face-closeup. |
| Hero animation (CH6/7/9/10) | **5** | CH6 met, from the bbox-top FFT: 3.52 Hz side, 3.50 Hz toward, 3.60 Hz 3/4. CH7 met: about 24° hip→neck on `hero_run_side_4k`. CH2 met: chase 0.42H at 2.0 s. Leap: crouch 1.40–1.60 s, a low hop 1.67–2.07 s. There is still no start, stop or turn, and every clip is a constant-speed loop. |
| Enemies (CH11–14) | **5** | CH11–13 met in `street_fight_34_4k`: 6 thugs at 0.23–0.39H, pipe plus bat, 5 silhouettes. Faces are scan-quality, but lips still read through the `tee_face` mask. `thug_face_4k` has a collar card shard (x1750–1960, y1340–1640), unchanged from r05 (collar-close A and B are identical). In the 8 s fight there are 2 pipe swings (0.25–0.75 s and 6.5–7.0 s), no knockdowns, and the hero kicks air at 1.25 s. |
| Civilians (CH16/17/19) | **4** | Hand count on `crowd_tracking` gives 10, 8 and 8 people at 1, 4 and 7 s, below the busy 16–25. The coat walker's rear foot flicks to knee height every stride (4.0 s, 7.0 s). Walkers interpenetrate: beanie man through the coat woman in `crowd_key_c_4k`, and black-tee's head inside the hoodie in `crowd_key_a_4k`. |
| Image quality (CH5/18) | **4** | Better than r05: the coat, hand and armpit are clean in `crowd_tracking_4k` and `crowd_key_a_4k`. CH18 still fails: in `crowd_key_c_4k` the rear jeans leg (x3215–3345, y1745–1940) is key-green (0,85,0), 19.5k of 25.4k px. A detached 37×27 px black triangle floats at (2225–2261, 1190–1216) in both key-c versions. Clips are 1080p. |

## A/B decisions (judged before identity)
- hero-run: **B**. It has starts, a crouch and a vault; A is a loop.
- hero-chase: **A**. It has traffic, a sprint and a launch; B is a small identical cycle.
- hero-standing: **A**. It has a grounded idle; B holds a mid-stride and uses the copied suit.
- suit-close and hero-face: **B**. It has a hex weave, raised lines and sealed rims.
- thugs-group and fight-clip: **B**. It has reactions, knockdowns and FX.
- thug-close: **B**. The face is readable, but the collar shard is visible.
- citizens-clip and citizens-still: **ref side**, for density and props.
- progress-crowd-still, coat-close, hand-close, armpit-close: **B**. A is shredded, clawed or holed.
- progress-key-a: **A**. B has a coat flap spike.
- progress-key-c, collar-close, progress-run, progress-crowd-clip: **tie**. Both have the same defects.

## Single biggest gap
**Crowd separation plus the key see-through (CH17/18).** Add walker avoidance with a capsule radius of at least 0.35 m. Then re-capture `crowd_key_c_4k` and `crowd_key_a_4k` and pass three checks:
- zero pixels with G>R+40 inside any garment silhouette;
- no two walker masks overlapping for more than 0 frames across `crowd_tracking` at 60 fps;
- no detached polygon larger than 4 px anywhere.

Prove it with 3× crops at the same coordinates.

## Secondary issues
1. Rebuild the lenses as one closed rim that seals to the lens, with no visible background. Replace the Advanced-Suit layout (IP).
2. Delete the collar card shard on the hoodie thug. Masks should drape, so no lip read. Blank the unreadable "SLI…" hoodie label.
3. Fight: every landed hit should stagger or knock down, and downed thugs stay down.
4. Cap the walk rear-foot lift at shin height, and raise density to at least 16 people in frame.

## Verdict: **FAILS TARGET**
Lowest axis 4 (hero model, civilians, image quality).
