# P4 Look / Sky: handoff (round 05 IN PROGRESS, resumed 2026-10-01 14:40 after the 14:26 Studio restart)

## Round 05 (Sky, director PLAN-firstpass "D Sky") - resume here
- Built + committed: C++ `AWHLookTimeOfDay` (`wh.TimeOfDay` 0-24 continuous, `wh.Weather`, live pins `exec wh.ToDSet <param> <v>` / `wh.ToDClear`), key table `Scripts/look_tod.py` (from the `tod` section of `Scripts/look_presets.json`),
  map `/Game/Tests/Look/Look_Midtown_tod` (rebuild: `tools/perf_ue/rebuild_look.sh rigs,maps tod`), time-lapse `tools/perf_ue/capture_tod_lapse.py`, one-session sweep runner `tools/perf_ue/sweeps/run_r05.py --plan <json>`, `tools/perf_ue/tod_tests.py` (spec numbers per variant).

Branch `night1/look`, worktree `~/sm2-n1/look`, UE MCP 8774, dev port 5205. Owns `/Game/Look`, `/Game/Tests/Look`, `tools/perf_ue/`, `Scripts/build_look.py`, `Scripts/look_presets.json`, `Scripts/look_ts_screens.json`,
`Source/WebHomage/Look/`, `docs/night1/look/`. Nothing in `Content/` is committed: scripts rebuild everything (`tools/perf_ue/rebuild_look.sh`).
Numbers of the round: `round-03/TESTS.md` (spec tables, 1080p and 4K, clips), `round-03/NOTES.md` (capture facts), `round-03/notes.json`. Targets: `docs/night1/look/SPEC.md` (LOOK-SPEC L1..L20). Shot list: `SHOTLIST.md`.

## State (end of round 03)
- Round-02 critic (`critic/round-02-CRITIC.md`): FAILS 4.3 avg. Ranked gaps: (1) build a real overcast midday, (2) far-field shading (far city takes the sky tint, 15..32 Y under the sky, no purple proxies / white shore band),
  (3) make night a night (B-R within +-13, bottom-third p10 15..30 / p90 >= 100). Round 03 addressed all three with preset v2 (below) and rebuilt the tooling so a look can be tuned live and measured in minutes.
- **Presets v2** (`Scripts/look_presets.json`, rebuilt by `rebuild_look.sh rigs[,night]`):
  - *midday* = overcast late morning (LOOK-SPEC L2): grey Rayleigh (`rayleigh_scattering` [.5,.5,.5], scale .03) so the sky is neutral, Mie .15 / anisotropy .6 haze, aerial-perspective distance 4, sky luminance factor 1.5, fog takes 3.5x
    sky ambient, sun 26000 lux with a 5 deg source angle (soft, no disk), sky light 2.3, **exposure = histogram average metering (low 10 % / high 90 %) with bias -0.7**, `film_white_clip` 0, shoulder .2, highlights gain .9, black lift .008.
  - *golden* = 9 deg sun behind the avenue ends, warm Mie haze (`mie_scattering` [1, .72, .45], scale .03, anisotropy .7, aerial distance 5) so the far shore takes the sky's orange, white temp 7800 K, cool sky-fill in the shadows,
    `film_white_clip` 0, shoulder .2, highlights gain .8. Exposure stays 70 % / 98 % histogram, bias .95.
  - *night* = dark facade masses with lit windows: moon 16 lux, sky light 2.5, city-glow fills x.85, Rayleigh tint [.3,.4,.7], fog density .012 (far shore 15..32 Y under the sky), white temp 6000 K, black lift (.0064, .008, .0144),
    exposure bias -.25; 634 lamps (spot 14000 cd, **cone 60 / 25 deg** = pools big enough for L14 p90), halo 120 cd, storefront spill 4000 cd, stand-in car heads 2000 cd.
  - Screens of the Times-Square-like district (`M_LookScreen`, `mat_screen`): every LED quad gets an emissive abstract content quad, built per (palette colour, aspect bin) so a 40 m tall panel becomes a stack of ad-like cells
    (gradient + soft blob + bars standing in for text lines + LED dot grid + rare flash). Pure maths, no text / logo / imagery (`IP_EXCLUSIONS.md`).
- **Tools** (all `tools/perf_ue/`, README lists them): `capture_tour.py` (one game session per preset and resolution visits the 8 shot poses through `Source/WebHomage/Look/WHLookTour.*`; `--variants <json>` = live look sweeps),
  `sweep_report.py` (ranks sweep variants against the spec), `look_spec_check.py` (spec numbers per still), `round_tests.py` (writes `round-NN/TESTS.md`), `clip_check.py` (clip numbers incl. L18), `capture_looks.py --clips --no-stills --no-warmup` (swing clips).

## Measured (round-03/TESTS.md; luma Y = .2126R + .7152G + .0722B of the 8-bit sRGB, stills resized to 1920 wide)
All numbers below are from the 3840x2160 native stills (native internal resolution, `r.ScreenPercentage 100`) unless noted; midday / golden 1920x1080 native stills agree within 1 Y (there are no night 1080p stills in round 03: the night preset was fine-tuned after the first 1080p pass, so only the final 4K set is kept). Round 02 for comparison: `round-02/TESTS.md`.
- **Midday (L2 overcast)**: frame means 85.2..94.5 on all eight views (band 83..97; round 02: 1 of 8 in band, means 62..91), near-black 0.00 % everywhere (limit 0.05 %; round 02 up to 7.3 %), B-R -12.0..+2.9 (band -19..+8),
  clipped 0.00 % on six views and 0.04 % on S3 and S7 (limit 0.00 %; round 02 up to 1.24 %). S4 far field: far shore 18.4 Y under the sky with B-R +0.2 from the sky (L10 -32..-15 / +-10 pass), horizon 9.1 Y above the sky (L11 >= +3 pass),
  far shore 9.5 Y above the river (P1 C14 pass). L17 glass p10 26..98 (>= 20 pass).
- **Golden (L1 / L5)**: means 74.8..110.0, seven of eight in 61..100 (S4 110.0 is sky-dominated), near-black 0.00 %, clipped <= 0.66 % except **S7 3.10 %** (L5 <= 0.7 %; round 02 2.58 %), B-R -19.6..-51.1 (band -55..-20; S3 -19.6 is 0.4 out; round 02 S2 / S4 were -66.7 / -57.1).
  S4 far field: far shore 26.3 Y under the sky (pass) but its B-R is +18.4 from the sky's (limit +-10) and it is 2.1 Y darker than the river (C14 wants +5..+35). L17: S8 right glass p10 16.6 (< 20).
- **Night (L3)**: means 39.4..58.1 (band 37..60), near-black 0.00 %, clipped 0.01..1.04 % (limit 1.7), **B-R -11.8..+5.9 on all eight (L8 +-13; round 02 S4 / S8 +26.9 / +19.8)**, S4 far shore 18.2 Y under the sky, B-R -7.8 from the sky (L10 pass),
  L13 lit blobs 14 / 14 / 9 on S1 / S5 / S6 (>= 5), L14 bottom-third p10 26.6 / 17.6 / 24.6 (15..30) and p90 167 / 133 / 119 (>= 100; round 02 S6 p90 94). The round-1 pools test (`night_tests.py`, peak >= 120, valley <= 40) gives S1 3 (target 4: the wider lamp cones merge neighbouring pools), S6 4.
- **Clips** (`swing_<preset>.mp4`, 1920x1080, 60 fps, 719 frames, internal 100 % of output, fixed 1/60 s step so they say nothing about real-time fps): midday (14.7 MB): hero pixel-box luma min 45.2 / p5 57.4 / mean 100.8 (frames below 40: 0 of 718). Frame numbers of every clip (mean Y, B-R, near-black, clipped, L18): `round-03/TESTS.md`. **Not captured this round: golden, night** (the GPU slot lock refused every launch for over an hour behind two UnrealEditor processes of other agents stuck exiting in the driver, pids 17555 / 17831; nothing was launched around the lock). Run `capture_looks.py --clips --no-stills --no-warmup --presets golden,night` first thing next round.

Live sweep format: `{"variants": {"name": ["exec showflag.fog 1", "set SkyAtmosphere - MieScatteringScale 0.03", "post AutoExposureBias 0.7", ...]}}`; `set <ActorLabel[*]> <ComponentClassSubstring|-> <Property> <text value>`, `post <CamelCaseProperty> <text>`.
Generators of the round's sweeps: `tools/perf_ue/sweeps/` (README there); the sweep stills of round 03 stay in `/Users/midir/sm2-n1/_scratch/look/eval/` (not committed).

## Gotchas learned this round
- **Live-sweep state is sticky**: a `set` / `post` line stays in force for every later variant of the session. Every variant must set every property that any variant of the file changes (an early golden sweep measured
  metering leaked from a previous variant). `gen_*` helpers set all keys each time.
- **Auto exposure decides the frame means.** `auto_exposure_low_percent` / `high_percent` choose the histogram window. 70 / 98 (bright-region metering, the default in `build_look.py`) makes sky-dominated frames darker and canyon frames
  brighter; 10 / 90 (average) equalises the eight shots' means (midday S1..S8 all 85..94). A sky-only change (sky luminance factor) is cancelled by the exposure when the sky is metered, so it does little for S4 / S7.
- Overcast is made from: neutral Rayleigh colour (blue Rayleigh = blue sky), sun disk 0 with a 5 deg angle, strong sky light, Mie haze for the bright horizon, fog picking up sky ambient (x3.5). Sun lux is what keeps S3 / S7 (sunlit rooftop / cross street) from going dark under average metering (26000).
- `film_white_clip` 0 + `color_gain_highlights` < 1 + shoulder .2 is what takes midday clipping to ~0 (`clipped` = any channel >= 250 counts, the midday limit is 0.00 %).
- Night: wide lamp cones (60 / 25 deg) are what make the bottom third of street views bright enough (p90 >= 100) without lifting the whole frame; more lamp power only raises the mean. Fog density 0.012 sets L10 (far shore under the sky).
- `Scripts/run_game.sh` (shared, not P4's) SIGKILLs the game at its `-timeout`. Always pass a large `-timeout` (the tools do: 5000 / 6000 / 7000); stop a hung game with `stop_ue.sh "<pattern that cannot match your own shell>"`, never `kill -9`.
- GPU queue: the slot lock is FIFO and the perf piece's exclusive runs (10..30 min each) block every capture behind them; a session that takes 1 min to run can wait 20..40 min. Plan sweeps as few, rich sessions (8..12 variants each).
- `unreal.Color` positional order is (B, G, R, A); use keywords. Atmosphere `ground_albedo` still positional (unchanged since round 01).

## Start of next round
- First: the two missing swing clips (`capture_looks.py --clips --no-stills --no-warmup --presets golden,night`), then `round_tests.py`; check `pgrep -fl UnrealEditor` / `ps -Ao pid,stat,command | grep '?E'` for engines stuck exiting before queueing anything.
- `unreal/WebHomage/{DerivedDataCache,Intermediate}` were deleted at the end of round 03 (idle rule): `build_editor.sh` recompiles the C++ and the first game run recompiles shaders (slow once).
- Merge `Opus-5.5-Loop-Night-1` first (city / traversal keep moving), `build_editor.sh` (editor closed), `rebuild_city.sh` if the city changed (it ends with the look rebuild), then `capture_tour.py` for the three presets.

## Open issues / next gap (facts, not self-assessment)
1. **Golden S7** (looking down a cross street toward the sun): 3.1 % of the pixels are clipped (the warm sky column at the end of the street; L5 wants <= 0.7 %). `film_white_clip` 0 / highlights gain .8 / shoulder .2 fix every other golden view (<= 0.66 %) but not this one;
   Mie scale 0.015 gives 1.9 % but breaks the far-shore tint (L10 B-R +26.8). Golden S4 mean 110 has the same root: sky-dominated frame under bright-region metering, sky-only changes (sky luminance factor) are cancelled by the exposure.
   Next idea: a different metering window for golden (a sweep showed 10 / 90 makes S3 / S7 too dark, so try 40 / 95 with a stronger sun) or a sun-aligned exposure compensation.
2. Golden S4 / L10 B-R (+18.4) and C14 (river brighter than the far shore): the river reflects the bright orange sky; sky luminance factor .65 / .65 / .65 brings L10 B-R to +11.8 but reddens S4 to -58 (past L6 -55); .65 / .70 / .85 gives +10.3 but S3 B-R -16.
3. Midday: S3 / S7 clipped 0.04 % (2000 px each; the limit is 0.005 %); a highlights gain of .8 would close it but takes S4 (85.2) under the 83 line; the overcast sky is a flat grey (the cloud deck `MI_LookClouds_midday` renders as a smooth dome): a textured deck (coverage / density MI variants, swapped live with
   `! set Clouds - Material /Game/Look/<mi>`) is the next visual step for S4 / S8 / the swing clip's sky.
4. Night: stand-in traffic is still boxes (P6 owns real traffic), tree foliage is bright green under the lamps (P1 material; the post grade cannot desaturate one hue), the LED content is procedural (abstract, by design).
5. **Perf was not run this round.** Night lamps now have 60 deg cones (46 before), storefront / head-light intensities doubled: the `Lights` pass grows; perf piece F should re-profile `Look_Midtown_night` (`run_perf.py`, GPU lock `perf`). Round 02 numbers (`round-02/PERF.md`) are for the old rig.
6. L18 (motion blur while swinging): `clip_check.py` measures edge / centre sharpness as mean |Laplacian| ratio; the critic's instrument was not available. Round 02 clips measure p50 .59 / .59 / .41 (midday / golden / night) with it, round 03 midday .78 (outside .20..+.65): content dependent;
   `motion_blur_amount` is 0.5 in every preset, raise it (0.7) if the critic flags it.
7. No runtime time-of-day blend (three fixed presets), no depth of field, no lens dirt, no sun shafts other than the volumetric fog.
